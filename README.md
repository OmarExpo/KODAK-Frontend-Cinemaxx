Description

This web app allows a user to search for movies according to the date chosen. Searchs allows users to find their desired movies based on different sorting and filtering. However, in a nutschell, once the user choose date, our app process through series of logic and display three options of morning / afternoon / evening. Thereafter, it will display three halls (i.e., A / B / C) and after selecting one of them, it will display the specific movie.


Design

We have designed the web app in accordance with the principles of web accessibility and the use of routing, specially Navigo. The design is simple and minimalistic in order for the web app to be intuitiv to use regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, concentration level. This allows the user to use the web app efficiently and conveniently. The specific design choices we made were a clean layout with few elements and readable font sizes.
